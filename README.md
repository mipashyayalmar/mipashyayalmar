### Hi there, I'm Prasad! 👋

👀 I'm passionate about **machine learning** and the endless possibilities it offers.

🌱 Currently, I'm delving into the world of **web design** while continuing my journey in **machine learning**.

💞️ My current goal is to collaborate on **GSOC** with **FOSSASIA** - an exciting opportunity to contribute to impactful projects!

📫 Reach out to me through my [Personal Portfolio](https://mipashyayalmar.github.io/-Profile-data/) - I'm always open to connecting and discussing potential collaborations.

😄 Pronouns: **pashya**

⚡ Fun fact: My college life is all about enjoying it on my own terms - creating my own rules and embracing every moment!
